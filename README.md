## Apple Store analysis and prediction - Method and Tools for BI
*Power BI, Excel*

The goal of the project being to perform a study on Apple Store applications to derive Performance Indicators and predict if an application will become popular. In order to do so, we needed to clean the dataset. After cleaning the dataset, we designed a model to perform our analysis. Then, we analyze our key indicators in order to setting ups more advancedd KPIs.

## Wine Quality Analysis - Data Analysis
*Python - Pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn*

For our data analysis final project, we chose to work on the Wine Quality dataset. This dataset contains oenological objectives and sensitive data. The dataset was created in 2009 by P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos and J. Reis in order to “Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties.”.

The aim of this project will be to treat and analyse this dataset in order to extract and identify the main objective criteria that makes a wine taste good.
