## Real Estate for Company - Data exploratory analysis and visualization
*SQL, Google Sheets, Google Data Studio, JavaScript, D3js*

Following my internship at [Spliit](https://www.spliit.fr/), a French startup reinventing real estate for company with digital tools, I developed a great interest in real estate Data.

### Mapping
Just after my arrival at Spliit, I started playing with data and making visualizations. I made some maps using D3js to better understand the distribution of new offers and transactions across the different districts of Paris.

### Article redaction
The first half of 2021 is very important in terms of data to understand whether the sector is recovering from the 2020 covid crisis. To understand this I have created several visualizations and their analysis which are recorded in an article that you can find on the Spliit website or with the link below.

## COVID-19 Analysis and Prediction - Artificial Intelligence
*Python - Pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn*

After numerous months affected by a sanitary crisis, the epidemiological situation is still evolving. I use this dataset which is daily updated. I downloaded my dataset December, 11, 2020. The aim of this project is to apply artificial intelligence methods to this dataset in order to make analyzes and predictions to help the society to better understand the spread of the COVID-19 infection.

## Wine Quality Analysis - Data Analysis
*Python - Pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn*

For our data analysis final project, we chose to work on the Wine Quality dataset. This dataset contains oenological objectives and sensitive data. The dataset was created in 2009 by P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos and J. Reis in order to “Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties.”.

The aim of this project will be to treat and analyse this dataset in order to extract and identify the main objective criteria that makes a wine taste good.

## Apple Store analysis and prediction - Method and Tools for BI
*Power BI, Excel*

The goal of the project being to perform a study on Apple Store applications to derive Performance Indicators and predict if an application will become popular. In order to do so, we needed to clean the dataset. After cleaning the dataset, we designed a model to perform our analysis. Then, we analyze our key indicators in order to setting ups more advancedd KPIs.
