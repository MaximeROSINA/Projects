# COVID-19 Analysis and Prediction - Artificial Intelligence


After numerous months affected by a sanitary crisis, the epidemiological situation is still evolving. I use this dataset which is daily updated. I downloaded my dataset  December, 11, 2020. 
The aim of this project is to apply artificial intelligence methods to this dataset in order to make analyzes and predictions to help the society to better understand the spread of the COVID-19 infection.


### I - Analysis of the dataset
### II - Bayes Nets
### III - Machine Learning
### IV - Improving the results and Theoretical formalism
### Conclusion
